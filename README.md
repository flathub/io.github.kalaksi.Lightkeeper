# LightkeeperRM

**LightkeeperRM (Remote Management) is a modular drop-in replacement for maintaining servers over SSH with shell commands.**
No additional daemons or other software is needed on servers. LightkeeperRM will only run standard Linux commands already available on the server.
You can see executed commands through debug log and, of course, on server's logs, so it's easy to audit and debug.

**LightkeeperRM aims to be customizable**, modular and easily extendable, so that it can be modified for different needs.

**User-interface is compact** and aims to keep only the most essential information visible. Clicking and navigating between different views is kept to a minimum.
In case you find the GUI insufficient and need to dig deeper, you can always use a button for launching a terminal that logs you in through SSH.

*NOTE: this is currently a pre-release and still has bugs and is missing some features. Documentation is also not yet complete.*
